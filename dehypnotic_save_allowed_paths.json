# Whitelist for Dehypnotic's Save nodes (Image and Audio)
# Add absolute root folders where saving is allowed outside ComfyUI/output.
# Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments.
# In addition to the node folder, you can place this file globally under your ComfyUI root:
# <ComfyUI>/save_mp3_allowed_paths.json
# <ComfyUI>/config/save_mp3_allowed_paths.json
# <ComfyUI>/user/save_mp3_allowed_paths.json
# <ComfyUI>/user/config/save_mp3_allowed_paths.json
# The node folder may be overwritten by future updates.
# Example:
# { "allowed_roots": ["D:/ImageExports", "E:/TeamShare/Assets"] }
{ "allowed_roots": [] }
